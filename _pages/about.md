Hi everyone! My name is Patrick, and I am a data nerd.

I recently completed a Masters in Analytics at Georgia Tech with a focus in Machine Learning. I am currently a Data Scientist Manager at USA Swimming, focusing on both marketing analytics and performance analytics.

In my free time, I enjoy working on college football rankings using various data science techniques. I also enjoy taking walks with my dog and assisting my wife, Cat, as a second photographer at weddings.
